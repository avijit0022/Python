## Problem 3
# Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below .

Input Format
```
First line contains t that denotes the number of test cases.
This is followed by t lines, each containing an integer N.
```
Constraints
```
1<=T<=10^5
1<=N<=10^9
```

Output Format
```
For each test case, print an integer that denotes the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.
```
Sample Input
```
2
10
100
```
Sample Output
```
23
2318
```
Explanation:
```
For N=10, if we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Similarly for N=100, we get 2318.
